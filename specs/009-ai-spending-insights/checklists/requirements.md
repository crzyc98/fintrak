- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

## Notes

- All items pass. Clarification session completed 2026-02-10 (3 questions asked).
- Clarified: UI placement (dashboard card), rate limiting (30s cooldown), persistence (ephemeral).
- Assumptions section documents reasonable defaults for anomaly threshold (3x category average), data freshness (ephemeral), cooldown (30s), and single-user scope.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
